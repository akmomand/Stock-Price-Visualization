Stock Analysis Streamlit App


Overview:
This project is a Streamlit app designed for visualizing stock data, offering users interactive controls to customize the display of stock information. The project is built on top of another publicly shared project, with permission to use and modify the original work. The LICENSE.txt file in this repository contains the license details and permissions.

Key Enhancements in This Project:
I have enhanced the original project with the following features:

1. Improved Time Frame Labels: The time frame labels were clarified for better user understanding. For example, instead of cryptic labels like 1M, the labels now explicitly say "1 Month."
Time Interval Functionality:

2. Added the ability for users to select a time interval (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day). This dynamically adjusts the granularity of the stock price graph. For example, selecting a "1-hour" interval shows stock data points aggregated by hourly changes on the X-axis.

3. 15 SMA Indicator: Added a checkbox that allows users to enable or disable the 15-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator on the graph.
When enabled, the 15 SMA is plotted as a red line, providing insights into the stock's short-term trend.

4. Interactive Plotting: Replaced the original static chart with a more customizable and visually appealing graph using plotly, allowing for better interaction.

5. Dynamic Y-Axis Range: The Y-axis now dynamically adjusts to focus only on the stock's price range, avoiding irrelevant empty space.
